# Hamburger Steak (60 min)

## Ingredients
* 2-3 Eggs `%`
* 1 Onion `@`
* 0.8-1 kg minced meat
* 10 ml salt
* 5 ml black pepper `@`
* 2 dl breadcrumbs
* 1 dl milk

## Time estimates
* 20 min to make the dough
* 40 min to fry

## Instructions
1. Take out the meat to warm up about 0.5-1 hour before you start.
1. Chop the onion into small pieces.
1. Pour the eggs into a bowl/pot that is enough big to fit all the ingredients.
1. Put the rest of the ingredients into the pot (including the onions).
1. Mix the dough. If you do not have anything else to mix with, you can use your bare hands(clean them first).
1. Fry the dough in a pan however you want. I prefer hamburger steaks, because they are fast and easy to fry. (When, you use low fat % meat like chicken, remember to use oil or something similar.)

## What to do with them
* You can put the hamburger steaks into the freezer for later.
* You can eat it between two slices of bread with things like cheese, salad and ketchup. When using a toaster, heat the bread you can heat the hamburger steak on top of the toaster.
